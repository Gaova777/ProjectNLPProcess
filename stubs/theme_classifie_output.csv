1,"A long time ago, a powerful demon foxappeared with nine tails.
 With its powerful tails,
 it could smash mountainsand create tidal waves.
 A band of Ninjas rose todefend their village from attack.
 We have to wait untilthe Fourth Hokage gets here!
 We can't let it get any closerto our village!
 One great Ninja was able toimprison the monster,
 but died in the process.
 This Ninja was known as…the Fourth Hokage.
 Naruto!
 Why did you do such a thing?!
 You're really gonna get it this time!
 I don't care!
 You know your problem?
 You can't do the things I do!
 Only I can do this!
 I'm better than all of you!Believe it!
 There's a problem, sir!
 Lord Hokage!
 What is it?
 Did that Naruto do something again?
 Yes. He climbed ontothe Mountainside Images…
 And he vandalized andgraffitied all over them!
 Wait!
 Ha ha…
 Why should I?
 Hey, Naruto!
 How did you suddenly get here,lruka Sensei?
 The question is what are you doing herewhen you should be in class now?
 Now listen, Naruto.
 You failed the last graduation testand the one before that.
 This is no timeto be goofing off, you fool!
 We will have a re-test onthe Transformation Jutsu!
 Even those who already passedwill take it!
 Whaaaat?!
 Sakura Haruno. Here I go…
 Transform!
 OK!
 I did it!
 Cha!
 Did you see that, Sasuke?
 Next, Sasuke Uchiha.
 Yes.
 O-OK.
 Next, Naruto Uzumaki.
 This is a real pain.
 And it's all your fault.
 Like I care!!
 OK…
 Good luck, Naruto…
 Transform!
 How was it?
 I call it the ""Sexy Jutsu""!
 You fool!Stop making idiotic spells!
 Darn…
 Darn…
 I won't let you go homeunless you clean that all up.
 I don't care…
 There's nobody home anyway.
 Naruto...
 What is it this time?
 What I meant was…
 If you clean up all that mess,I'll buy you ramen tonight.
 Huh?!
 Yes!I-I will finish it no time!
 Enter: Naruto Uzumaki!
 Naruto.
 Why did you vandalize those faces?
 Don't you know whothe Hokage leaders are?
 Of course, I do!
 I know they earned the titleLord Hokage
 because they were the best Ninjaof their time, right?
 Especially the Fourth Hokagewas a hero
 who saved the village fromthe nine-tail demon fox.
 Then why did you do that?
 Because I'll become a Hokage myself.
 And I'll be the greatest Hokageof all time!
 So that everyone will finallylearn to accept me!
 By the way, Sensei,I have a favor to ask.
 You want another bowl?
 Mmmm…No…
 Can I borrow that Leaf headbandfor a while?
 This?
 No no!
 This is worn only by those whohave graduated from Ninja Academy.
 Tomorrow, you will…
 You're so mean!
 So that's why you took offyour goggles…
 Humph...One more bowl please!
 We are now about to beginthe graduation test.
 When your name is called,proceed to the next classroom.
 The test is on the Clone Jutsu.
 Oh no…
 Of all the…! That is my weakest Jutsu!
 But still…I will do it no matter what!
 Clone Jutsu!
 Disqualified!
 Iruka Sensei.
 His physical coordinationand stamina are excellent.
 And he managed to come upwith something.
 Isn't that enoughfor him to pass?
 Mizuki Sensei...All the others created three or more clones.
 Naruto created just one.
 And it's practically useless.I can't give him a passing mark.
 I 'm a Ninja now!
 You did well. That's my son.
 Congratulations for your graduation.
 I'll cook something good tonight!
 Look at that one.
 It's that boy.I hear he's the only one who failed.
 Serves him right.
 Imagine what would happenif he became a Ninja.
 Isn't that the boywho is actually…
 Hey! We're not supposed totalk about that.
 Iruka.We need to talk later.
 Yes, sir.
 Iruka Sensei isn't tryingto be mean to you.
 Then why only me?
 He wants you to become strongfrom the bottom of his heart.
 You both don't have parents.
 But I really wanted to graduate.
 Heh... I guess I have no choice…
 I'll let you in on a big secret.
 Secret?
 Iruka.
 What is it, Lord Hokage?
 I know how you feel. But…
 Naruto also grew up without knowingthe love of his parents…like you.
 Let me go!
 My mom and dad arestill out there fighting!
 Wake up, Iruka Sensei!
 What's the matter?
 Come to Lord Hokage's immediately!
 I heard that Naruto…stole the Scroll of Sealing.
 The Scroll of Sealing?!
 Let's see…
 The first Jutsu is…Multi-Shadow Clone Jutsu?
 What?! Already a Jutsu I'm no good at?
 Lord Hokage!We can't forgive him!
 This is not just a prank!
 The Scroll is a dangerous itemthat the First Hokage sealed!
 Depending on its use…
 It will be a major disaster ifit is taken out of the village!
 Yes. Bring Naruto here at once!
 Yes, sir!
 Where did you go…Naruto?
 I will tell everyone in the villageabout this and eliminate Naruto…
 Then the Scroll of Sealingwill be mine!
 Hey you, Naruto!
 You found me..
 And I've only learned one Jutsu.
 He's been practicing the Jutsu…
 until he's becomethis exhausted and dirty…?
 Listen, listen!I'm gonna show you this amazing Jutsu!
 You're gonna let me graduateif I can do it!
 Isn't it true that I can graduate ifI can do one of the Jutsu written here?
 Who told you that?
 Mizuki Sensei. He told meabout this scroll, and this place…
 Mizuki did?!
 I'm impressed you found this place.
 I see now…how it is.
 Naruto, give me that scroll.
 Wait, wait…What's going on here?
 Naruto! Never give him that scroll!
 It is a dangerous object that containsforbidden Ninja Jutsu. It was sealed.
 Mizuki used you in order toget it for himself!
 W-Wha--?
 Naruto, Iruka is only afraid ofyou holding that scroll!
 Huh?
 What are you saying, Mizuki!Don't let him fool you, Naruto!
 I will tell you the truth.
 Idiot! Don't do that!
 After an incident 12 years ago,a rule was created.
 A rule?
 That is, Naruto, a rule everybodybut you knows.
 Except me?! 					What is it?
 Stop it, Mizuki!
 The rule forbids anyone from revealingthat you are actually the Demon Fox Spirit!
 Huh?
 You are actually the Demon,Nine-Tailed Fox Spirit,
 who killed Iruka's parents anddestroyed our village!
 Stop it!
 Everyone has beendeceiving you ever since.
 Didn't you find it strange?
 Why everyone hated you so much?
 No! No! No! No! No!
 Naruto…
 Nobody accepts you.That's why Iruka hates you so much!
 Iruka... Naruto grew upwithout the love of parents.
 Everyone avoids him likethe plague after what happened.
 That's why he keeps misbehaving.
 It's the only way for him to getany attention or acknowledgement.
 He pretends to be tough,but inside he is really hurting.
 Die, Naruto!
 Naruto! 					Get down!
 Why…?
 Because you and I are the same.
 After my parents died,
 nobody paid attention to meor gave me any support.
 I wasn't a good student in school.
 I was the class clown…because I wanted people to notice me.
 I couldn't get noticed through excellence,so I kept doing stupid things.
 It was so hard.
 Isn't that right, Naruto?
 You felt so lonely…right?And you suffered inside, right?
 I'm sorry, Naruto….
 If I had been more responsible,maybe you wouldn't have suffered so much.
 Don't make me laugh!
 Iruka has always hated you,ever since you killed his parents!
 He's just saying all thatto get the Scroll of Sealing back!
 Naruto!
 Narutoooooo!
 He is not the type of kidwho will change his mind.
 He will take revenge againstour village using that scroll!
 Didn't you see his eyes?Those are the eyes of a Demon Fox.
 No…Naruto…isn't…like that at all!
 All I want is to kill Narutoand get the scroll.
 I'll take care of you later!
 I-I won't let you…
 Well, well.
 Mizuki has a big mouth!
 Naruto feels worse than he's ever felt.
 He might unleashthe power locked up inside him.
 The Scroll of Sealing is now with him.
 There's a slight chancehe might actually release
 the Nine-Tailed Fox Spiritsealed inside him!
 If that happens…
 I've found him!
 Naruto!
 Everything that Mizuki saidwas a lie!
 Give me that scroll, quick!Mizuki is after the scroll!
 It can't be…
 Why is it, Naruto?
 How…
 did you know I wasn't Iruka…?
 Because I'm Iruka.
 I see.
 What's in it for you to protectthe one who killed your family?
 I'm not gonna let a stupid idiotlike you get that scroll!
 You're the idiot.Naruto is the same as me.
 Same?
 Anyone can do whateverhe wants once he has the scroll.
 There is no way that that monster…
 that Fox Spirit, won't take advantageof the power of that scroll!
 You're right…
 I guess it was true all along!
 See, Iruka Sensei never reallycared for me at all!
 ...if he was the Demon Fox Spirit.
 But Naruto is different!
 I know that he is an exceptional student.
 He works very hard,
 and he's single-mindedand clumsy at the same time.
 No one accepts him, but he knowsthe meaning of human suffering.
 He is not the Demon Fox Spirit.
 He's Naruto Uzumaki ofthe Village Hidden in the Leaves!
 You are so gullible. 					lruka!
 I was gonna take you down later,but I have changed my mind.
 Die!
 I guess this is the end for me…
 Naruto?!
 You surprised me there, freak.
 If you ever lay a hand on Iruka Sensei,I'll kill you!
 Shut up! I can take care of a kidlike you with a single blow!
 Why don't you try then?I'll strike you back a thousand-fold!
 Let's see you try!Show me what you can do, Demon Fox!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Naruto! You've…
 Those aren't just images but actual clones!That's an advanced Ninjutsu!
 What's this…?
 What's the matter? 					C'mon!
 Weren't you gonna get mewith one blow? Here!
 In that case…I'll come to you.
 I kinda got carried away.lruka Sensei, are you okay?
 Yeah.
 He's really something.
 Maybe it is true.
 Maybe he will surpass allthe Hokage leaders…
 Naruto, come over here.I'd like to give you something.
 Has anyone found Naruto yet?
 No.
 Darn, this is going to be bad…
 There's no need to worry anymore.
 Lord Hokage!
 He'll be back soon.
 Sensei, how much longer?
 OK, you may open your eyes now.
 Congratulations…on your graduation.
 In celebration, we'll have ramen tonight!
 Iruka Sensei!
 That hurts!
 Naruto…
 I was going to lecture to you...
 that the road gets more difficultnow that you're a Ninja.
 But I guess I'll just wait to tell youthat until we get to the ramen stand…
 W-What do you want, you little shrimp?Quit following me!
 You're smaller than me and
 you're saying that you're gonnabecome the Fifth Hokage?
 I don't care if you are the 3rd Hokage'sgrandson or not.
 It's not that easy to be a Hokage!
 If you want it that bad,you're gonna have to beat me first!

2,"C'mon!
 Running like a fugitive,
 Being chased by something
 Inside my heart is pounding
 My throat dry like it's withering
 For no single one,
 To none does belong,
 This time is ours, right now...
 Unraveling the pain,
 Unraveling our hearts,
 Unraveling shadows
 Stifling our breath,
 Reaching for beyond,
 Tearing through the dark
 In fighting and in love
 To the distant light above,
 Yes, we are on the way
 I wanna rock...
 Rockin' my heart
 Hey, you!
 Are you sure you wantto look like that?
 Yes, of course!C'mon! So hurry hurry!
 Don't regret it later.
 Say cheese!
 My Name Is Konohamaru!
 I couldn't decide on how to look.
 It took me 3 hours to decide.
 But as you can see,it's more like a work of art.
 Doesn't it look great?
 Take it over.
 What?!
 Take it over.
 Stop saying that!
 Transform!
 Oh please, Lord Hokage…
 The Sexy Jutsu…That's quite a devious technique.
 By the way Naruto,where's your headband?
 I won't wear it until the orientation.lt might get scratched
 Well, that's just fine.
 But the Ninja Registration Formis a very important document
 held in high regard by our village.
 Why do you want to look like this?
 Because!
 Anyway, how should I knowabout all that stuff?
 Old man!Get ready to fight!
 I am going to be the Fifth Hokage!
 Ouch!
 If it's not one thing, it's another….
 Drat! Is this a trap?
 Are you okay,Honorable Grandson?
 May I just inform you thatthere aren't any traps here…
 Huh? What's with this runt?
 What?!
 I know this kid…He's that Nine-Tailed boy!
 He's a good-for-nothing scoundrel!
 You must have done this to me!
 You tripped all by yourself, stupid!
 Hey! Let go of him!
 He is the Honorable Grandsonof the Third Hokage!
 He stopped as soon ashe learned who I am….
 He's like my four-eyed teacher.
 He's just like everyone else!
 What's the matter?
 Weren't you gonna hit me, huh?
 Can't do it 'cuzI'm the Hokage's grandson, eh?
 As if I care! 					lmbecile!
 This guy…
 What?!
 Good grief…
 Listen to me.
 You are the Honorable Grandsonof the Third Hokage.
 Even though that scoundrel hit you,you must not associate with his kind.
 Nothing good will come ofyour tangling with him.
 This is your distinguishedteacher Ebisu,
 and I am never wrongabout these things!
 Don't you want to becomethe Fifth Hokage?
 Then allow meto teach you Ninjutsu,
 so that your dream willbecome a reality.
 That's right.
 Stick with me and you will gain a shortcuttowards becoming the Fifth Hokage.
 Is that clear, Honorable Grandson?
 He's gone!
 It seems he's gone after Naruto.
 Oh no!
 This is terrible!
 Honorable Grandson!
 How did he become like this?
 That was the 20th sneak attack today.
 And now he's in the company of Naruto.I'm a bit worried.
 I just hope he doesn't pick upmore foolishness.
 Huh?
 Stop following me!
 What is it now?!
 Your camouflage is pathetic.
 You've seen through my disguise...
 Your reputation is well-earned.
 I will allow you to make meyour apprentice.
 But you must first teach me that ""Sexy Jutsu""  technique
 you used to beat Grandpa Hokage.
 You gotta be kidding.
 I beg you to say yes, boss!
 Huh?
 Boss?
 Boss! Boss! Boss!
 I guess I have no choice.
 Listen.
 In order to become a skilled Ninja,
 you must first learn tocontrol your Chatora.
 Chatora?
 Yes, Chatora.
 Boss, I think you mean Chakra.
 Silence!
 That's what real Ninjas call it!
 Oh! I didn't know that!
 Whew… I'm glad he's a fool.
 Listen. Chakra essentially means…
 Basically, it is the energy neededin order to use Jutsu.
 Huh?
 In other words, fundamentally Ninja Artscombine the Chakra,
 the physical energy accumulatedfrom each cell in the body
 with spiritual energy intensifiedthrough training and experience.
 This combined energy is summonedwith certain hand signs.
 You made me thinkyou knew all that,
 when you were just readingfrom a scroll!
 Much has been said aboutperfecting the Ninja techniques,
 but it really boils downto just one thing.
 And what is that?
 Hard work and guts.
 Hard work and guts?
 That's right.
 So be ready for the challenging tasksI will give you.
 Yes, boss!
 Good. Let's start right now.Transform for me.
 Huh?
 Let me see firsthow much you already know.
 But what do I transform into?
 OK... First, transform into that lady.
 An easy task, boss.
 Transform!
 Well, do I look like her?
 Uhm… Well, the clothes do and…
 And what's so similarabout that?!
 Honorable Grandson.
 If you will transform into me,at least try to look a little cuter, OK?
 She's scary!
 Why am I the one who gets hit?
 OK!Next, we'll do some research on sexiness!
 Yes, boss!
 I told you I don't allowreading here, Naruto!
 This is the last test.Put all of your effort into it!
 Yes, boss!
 Transform!
 Naruto! It's you again!
 Why is it always me…?
 Sorry.
 Huh?
 It's becauseI'm the Hokage's grandson.
 Don't worry about it.
 Huh?
 You're now ready to performthe Sexy Jutsu!
 You just need more practice.
 Yes, boss!
 OK, keep in mind…the point is for ""boom boom boom""!
 Now do it!
 Yes, boss! 					Transform!
 What do you think?
 That won't do!
 More slender.
 Yes, boss!
 Is this okay?
 Not yet. 					More attractive.
 Yes, boss!
 How about now?
 That Naruto… What is he teachingthe Honorable Grandson…?
 Where the hell could they be…?
 I am a distinguished teachertraining potential Hokage.
 All those who interferewill be eliminated.
 You know I've been wondering…
 You seem obsessed with beatingyour Grandpa Hokage.
 My name is Konohamaru.
 It was Grandpa who gave methat name.
 He named me after our village.
 It should be easy for everyonehere to remember.
 But nobody ever calls meby that name.
 When they see me, all they seeis the grandson of Lord Hokage.
 No one sees me for who I really am.
 I can't stand it anymore.
 That's why…
 That's why I want the titleof Lord Hokage now.
 Idiot…Who do you thinkwill accept you, huh?
 Huh?
 You won't win the titlethat easily, you know.
 What?!
 It's not that simple.
 If you're really serious about gainingthe title of Lord Hokage…
 What?
 You'll have to beat me first!
 Lord Hokage!I've been looking for you.
 Iruka.
 Did Naruto re-submithis Ninja Registration Form?
 Yes.
 When I lectured to him the other nightat the ramen stand,
 he said he will make everyone accept himnow that he's a Ninja.
 He's been happy since then.
 It might not be easy for Narutoto realize that dream.
 Huh?
 As you well know,
 only the villagers who foughtthe Nine-Tailed Fox Spirit 12 years ago
 know that the monster is sealedinside Naruto.
 I ruled that no one shall speakabout that incident.
 I have severely punished thosewho have broken this rule.
 Now our children know nothing about it.
 That is the only positivedevelopment for Naruto.
 Before the Fourth Hokage trappedthe monster and died,
 his last wish was for the villagersto regard Naruto as a hero.
 A hero?
 The Fourth Hokage sealed the monsterinto the navel of a newborn baby
 whose umbilical cordhad just been cut.
 As the receptaclefor the Nine-Tailed Fox Spirit,
 Naruto saved the village.
 Unfortunately, the other villagersdon't see him like that.
 Some even say that Naruto isthe Nine-Tailed Fox Spirit himself.
 Little by little, that attitude has beenpassed down to their own children.
 Iruka. 					Do you know?
 What, sir?
 When someone is hated and people refuseto accept his existence,
 he sees it in the eyesof the people around him.
 I have found you!
 Huh?
 That Demon Fox!!
 That cold look!lt's always like that!
 Honorable Grandson,we have to go now.
 No way!
 I want to beat Grandpa right nowso I can win the title of Lord Hokage!
 Don't get in my way!
 A Hokage must first know about virtue,honor, etiquette, wisdom, loyalty, faith,
 judgment, obedienceand all that.
 He must be skilled at more thanthousand techniques…
 And then...
 Transform!
 Take this! Sexy Jutsu!
 What? 					lt didn't work!
 What kind of adisgraceful spell is that?!
 I am a gentleman!
 Such vulgar attackswill never work on me!
 Honorable Grandson!That rascal will only make you an imbecile!
 Stick with me and...
 you will gain a shortcuttowards becoming the Fifth Hokage.
 C'mon, let's go!
 No way!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu
 Wow! 					Fantastic!
 Ha! 					That's nothing.
 I am a distinguished teacher.
 I am not as weak as Mizuki.
 Boss…
 Transform!
 Transform!
 Oh, Master Ebisu…
 I call it ""the Harem Jutsu""!
 He combined the Multiple Clones withhis own Sexy Jutsu.
 That's another devious attack.
 I probably won't even survive that one.
 I can't even beat thatfour-eyed teacher of mine!
 I want the title of Lord Hokage so badly!I want to be recognized by everybody!
 But I keep failing.
 You think it's that easy?
 Huh?
 It's given only to the greatest Ninjain the village.
 Everybody must learn to believe in you.
 I've been through a lot already.
 It's been one struggle after another.
 But after all that,I found someone who accepts me.
 I had to go through a lot...Just for one person.
 You had better push yourself.
 For what?
 The path of getting the title,Lord Hokage, is a brutal one.
 There's no such thing as a shortcut.
 If you're really serious aboutattaining the title of Lord Hokage
 You'll have to beat me first.
 Who do you think you are,lecturing me like that?
 I won't be your apprentice anymore.
 From now on, you're my rival.
 Unfortunately for you,tomorrow I graduate from the Ninja Academy.
 Still, I'll consider you an equal somedaywhen we fight for the title of Lord Hokage.
 Let's look forward to that, Konohamaru.
 You still have a long way to goto become a real Ninja.
 Aaah! Why do I have to be inthe same group with Sasuke?
 The guy I hate the most?
 Sakura keeps saying ""Sasuke Sasuke Sasuke!""
 and doesn't evenpay attention to me!
 It makes me so mad!I got it! I'm going to pull one on him!
 I'm not gonna let him be so coolin front of Sakura!
 Next Episode: ""Sasuke and Sakura: Friends or Foes?""
